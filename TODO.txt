WHOIS response for NickServ ID'ed users:
Unreal:
   307: cyanite is a registered nick
Freenode:
   320: cyanite is identified to services




• Better exceptions from dir_walk in configspace (on missing meta).

• Protect topic command with 'topic' capability.

• Help for config space is ok. But we need:
   · Help for plugins.
   · Help for commands (more than USAGE).

• Create an admin (or similar) plugin for stuff like quit, load, disconnect etc., and make it possible
  to dynamically connect to new servers, disconnect and join/part etc. Also, move say, do etc. to a plugin
  called something like comm or communication.

• IRC base as well as the bot should handle being PARTed, KICKed, QUITed etc.

• Figure out frameworks for:
   · Regaining OP if lost, or if needed at some point.
   · Dealing with abuse (support punishment).

• React, maybe, to services private notices. Perhaps not needed.

• Prefix log messages with current time

• Give a full stack trace for caught exceptions

• Support globs/patterns for $seen

• Tell user when he is not identified with the IRC server and tries to use $notes or similar

• Maybe make $notes only use WHOIS rather than require $register/$identify

• Always check WHOIS prior to $whoami/$note/$notes (might be obsolote if we do the above)

• Do not write out the config-space when nothing has changed. I have a test branch with a test config file, and after each test-run I get a different config file written to disk (re-ordering of items in the hash) which means I have to revert the config file before I can leave the branch.

• Ask for a WHO list after joining a channel, to collect masks.
• Delay calling on_init until we get that list.
• Leading ~ apparently does NOT mean IRC Operator. Figure out what it means, and fix it.
